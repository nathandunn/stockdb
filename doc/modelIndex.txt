A - Strain Index
B - Genus
C - Stock  (composed of strain, location, and box #)
    D - Phylum
    E - ? <- Ignore for now
    F - ? <- Ignore for now
    G - ? <- Ignore for now
    H - Origin: <stage> <species> (<genotype>) <host anatomy> notes 
    I - Host Facility
    J - Location <- This should be included in C (I think that's what you have indicated)
    K - Isolate: <oxygen condition>; <temperature>; <media>; notes
    L - Strain (RAST sequence URL) <- I think the best way to deal with the genomes is to have a genome group which is a attached to each strain that includes <RAST sequence URL> <Genome Size> <Genome Quality> <genome note> and <Experiment (which would include the researcher that assembled the genome) >. I guess this would be a property of strain anyway so this would be redundant?
    M - Strain (genome Size)
    N - Strain (genome quality)
    O - Strain (genome note)
    P - Strain (date created)
    Q - Isolation (isolatedWhen)
    R - Isolation (isolatedBy) or (Researcher)
    S - Strain (formerCloneAlias) 
    T - Strain (motility) <- Would be a Measured Value, but can ignore for now
    U - ? <- Would be a Measured Value, but can ignore for now
    V - ? <- Would be a Measured Value, but can ignore for now
    W - ? <- Would be a Measured Value, but can ignore for now
    X - ? <- Would be a Measured Value, but can ignore for now
    Y - Strain (note)
    Z - ? <- Would be a Measured Value, but can ignore for now
    AA - ? <- I'm not sure what this is so just ignore it
